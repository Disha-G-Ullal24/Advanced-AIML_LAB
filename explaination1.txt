1)Implement a simple reflex agent in python to navigate a grid enviourment avoiding obstackles and performing basic tasks. 
Rules:
1.Simple reflex agent - Acts based only on current percept (no memory).
Problem Setup:
A grid world of size M x N.
Some cells have obstacles.
Some cells have tasks (e.g., cleaning or picking up an item).
The agent senses the current cells state (obstacle? task?).
The agent moves (up/down/left/right) based on simple rules.

Rules:
agent-A
obstackles-O
tasks-T (MORE THN ONE TASK SHLD B THERE)

The agent starts at the top-left corner (row 0, column 0).
Each step, the agent:
Checks if it is currently on a task cell.
If yes, it “performs the task” (clears that task from the grid).
Otherwise, it tries to move right, down, left, or up in that order.
It only moves if the next cell is inside the grid and not an obstacle.
If no move is possible, it stops moving.
