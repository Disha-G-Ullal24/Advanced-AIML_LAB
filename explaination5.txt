📌 Code Block:
# Probability Calculation
probability = len(event) / len(sample_space)


👉 Here we calculate the probability of the event.

len(event) → number of favorable outcomes.

len(sample_space) → total number of possible outcomes (6 for a dice).

Formula:

𝑃
(
𝐸
)
=
∣
𝐸
∣
∣
𝑆
∣
P(E)=
∣S∣
∣E∣
	​


Example: Event = {2,4,6}, then 
𝑃
(
𝐸
)
=
3
/
6
=
0.5
P(E)=3/6=0.5.

# Show results
print(f"\nEvent Chosen (E): {event_name}")


👉 Prints the name of the event chosen by the user, like "Even numbers".

print(f"Favorable Outcomes (E): {event}")


👉 Displays the actual set of favorable outcomes, e.g., {2, 4, 6}.

print(f"Number of outcomes in E: {len(event)}")


👉 Shows how many outcomes are in event 
𝐸
E.
For even numbers, this is 3.

print(f"Probability P(E) = |E| / |S| = {len(event)} / {len(sample_space)} = {probability:.2f}")


👉 Prints the probability in notation form:

|E| = size of event set.

|S| = size of sample space.

{probability:.2f} → formats the probability to 2 decimal places.
Example output:
Probability P(E) = |E| / |S| = 3 / 6 = 0.50

# Optional: Simulate a dice roll
roll = random.choice(list(sample_space))


👉 Simulates a real dice roll.

random.choice(list(sample_space)) randomly picks one element from the sample space {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Example: It may roll 4.

print("\nSimulating a dice roll...")
print("Dice rolled:", roll)


👉 Prints messages to show the random dice roll result.
Example: Dice rolled: 4

if roll in event:
    print("The event occurred ")
else:
    print("The event did not occur ")


👉 This checks whether the rolled value belongs to the event set.

if roll in event: → True if the dice roll matches the event (favorable outcome).

If yes → "The event occurred".

If no → "The event did not occur".

🔹 Example:

Event = {2,4,6} (even numbers).

Dice rolled = 4.

4 in {2,4,6} → True → "The event occurred".

If Dice rolled = 3, "The event did not occur".
