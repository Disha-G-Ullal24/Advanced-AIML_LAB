import random: brings in Pythonâ€™s random module to generate random numbers.

# Secret number between 1 and 50: comment explaining the next line.

secret = random.randint(1, 50): picks a random integer from 1 to 50 (inclusive) and stores it in secret.

print("Guess the number between 1 and 50!"): prints instructions for the player.

while True: starts an infinite loop; weâ€™ll break out when the guess is correct.

guess = int(input("Enter your guess: ")): asks the user for a guess (string), converts it to an integer, and stores it in guess.

if guess < secret: checks if the guess is smaller than the secret number.

print("Too low! Try again."): feedback for a low guess.

elif guess > secret: checks if the guess is larger than the secret number.

print("Too high! Try again."): feedback for a high guess.

else: runs only when guess == secret.

print("ðŸŽ‰ Correct! The secret number was", secret): success message revealing the secret.

break: exits the while True loop, ending the game.
